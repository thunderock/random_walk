# random_walk
Optimized Random Walk implemented in C++ and then exposed via Cython.

Random walks are a basic and central method leveraged to learn node representations in Graph ML, yet I could not find an optimized implementation that works for weighted graphs. Hope this helps fill that gap for you.
